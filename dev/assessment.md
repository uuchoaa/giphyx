# Giphy API Integration Assessment

We'd like to see how you would build a simple front-end around the Giphy API.

This test is designed to evaluate your problem-solving skills and creativity. This test is open-ended â€“ meaning, how you approach and implement the solution is entirely up to you.

You can use any framework, libraries, or tools you feel most comfortable with. While we use Vue and Nuxt for our front-end, we want to be respectful of your time and make sure you are most productive in your choice of tools.

  Important: We ask you to spend **no more than 2 hours on this task**.

## Goal
We'd like you to build a simple app that allows users to search the API and displays gifs returned from the API.

The features we're looking for are:

* Search functionality: Users should be able to search for gifs.
* Related gifs feature: When a user clicks on an individual gif, they should be presented with related gifs.

Beyond that, we have intentionally left this assessment open-ended to see how you approach the full problem space and prioritize what is important.

### Giphy API
You will need to get a Giphy API key in order to make requests. To get this key:

1. create an account at Giphy
2. create an app from the developer dashboard

After creation of the app, you will be presented with an API key. You will use this key to make calls.

Giphy API documentation [can be found here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide).

## Completion
When you are done, please email a link to a repository we can check out. We will then schedule a time to discuss your notes about the trade-offs you made due to the 2 hour time constraints.
